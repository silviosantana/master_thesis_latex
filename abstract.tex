\SSDEL{This work presents an algorithm to generate properties for pipelined processors. The proposed algorithm extends \TLREP{a Property-First design}{Property-Driven development, a design} flow where \TLINS{formal} properties are generated by a tool for a given system-level description of the design. These generated properties are converted into a pipeline property set which reflects the particularities of a pipeline processor behaviour. The property set is refined simultaneously with the RTL implementation on a \textit{refine-and-implement} process. In the end, when the complete set of refined properties hold to the implemented design, a trusted ESL model of the processor is obtained. \TLSAY{the ESL can be trusted} 

A case study for an existent RISC-V processor implementation is presented. A SystemC description of the processor core is implemented, and the algorithm is applied to create the set of pipeline properties. These properties are refined until they hold to the given RTL implementation. The experimental results evidence an improvement \TLSAY{Just reduced effort?} on the effort to create and refine the property set compared to a set of properties generated from the RTL implementation in a \textit{bottom-up} approach, and they confirm the simulation \textit{speedup} for the ESL model compared to the RTL simulation.}

\SSDEL{For the past decades, digital designs, including processor cores, have had design descriptions at the \textit{Register Transfer Level}~(RTL) as their trusted reference models. Even though much work has been done for system-level descriptions of processors, \textit{Electronic-System Level}~(ESL) models are still primarily used for fast prototyping. The main reason for this is the absence of a formal relationship between ESL and RTL models. In this work, an algorithm for property generation for pipelined processors in a Property-Driven Design approach is proposed. The properties are generated from an abstract description of the processor, and later refined along with the processor design process.

The property set generated form the ESL model, and which holds for the implemented RTL, establishes a formal relationship between the two models. This allows the ESL description to be used as the reference model for the design. The experiments present a case study for an existent RISC-V processor core implementation, where an ESL model for the core is implemented and the proposed algorithm is employed to generate the property set. The properties are refined until they hold for the RTL implementation resulting on an ESL that can be trusted as a reference model of the processor. The results also evidence the simulation \textit{speedup} of the ESL model in comparison to the RTL simulation, and a reduction on the complexity and effort for generating a property set for the pipeline processor.}

\TLSAY{Now you explained only WHAT you have done. Not WHY. An abstract should provide intuition also to people that don't know anything about your work. Any computer engineering student should be able to understand the abstract. give it one more try. Now it's way to detailed. No big picture. The previous one was better. If you can't nail it we will just remove it.} 

\aTLSAY{It's an okay abstract but not a really good one. It's not general enough and it does not capture the ideas. For someone who does not know PDD it won't provide anything. Try to be more abstract (thats the hardest party of writing) ... usually it helps to only answer the questions "Why? Why is this important? Why is this interesting? Why is the problem for your solution interesting to look at} 

\SSINS{“Property-Driven Design (PDD)” is a top-down methodology for Register Transfer Level (RTL) design. It starts from an abstract description of the system, and it incorporates formal property checking methods early into the design process in order to establish a formal relationship between abstract model and RTL implementation. The proposed approach extends the PDD methodology so it can be efficiently employed in design of pipelined processors. In PDD, properties are automatically generated aiming to avoid high efforts associated with verification by property checking. This work presents an algorithm to convert these generated properties into a property set that captures the pipeline behaviour of a processor core.

At the end of the processor design flow, a formally verified RTL implementation is available along with a formal relationship between concrete implementation and abstract model. This allows the abstract model to be used beyond prototyping purposes, as it also represents a trusted reference of the design. The experiments present a case study for an existent RISC-V processor core implementation. The resulting property set generated from an abstract implementation of the core hold for the given RTL model establishing a formal relationship between the two models. The results also evidence the simulation \textit{speedup} of the abstract model in comparison to the RTL simulation, and a reduction on the complexity and effort for generating a property set for the pipeline processor in comparison to property verification on a bottom-up approach.}
