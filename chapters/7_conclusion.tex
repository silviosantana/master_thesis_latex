This work presents an algorithm for property generation for pipeline processors that extends a \textit{Property-Driven Design}~(PDD) approach. This methodology establishes a formal relationship between the system-level description, e.g. ESL, and the RTL implementation of a design. Such relationship allows the ESL model to be trusted as the reference model of the design. Starting from an abstract SystemC-PPA description of the processor, a set of properties are generated, merged using the proposed algorithm, and later refined along with the implementation of the RTL design. Property checking verification method is used to check the refined property set on the resulting RTL. When the property set holds for the RTL, the formal relationship between the two models is guaranteed.

A case study for a RISC-V processor implementation, the RI5CY core, was performed in this work. A SystemC-PPA description for the base instruction set of the core was implemented, and a set of properties generated from it using the DeSCAM tool. The Pipeline Algorithm was employed to merge the properties into a set of pipeline properties. For completeness, a set of \SSQED{} properties was written for the core as well. This property set was refined according to the signals and control registers of the given RTL processor implementation until all the properties hold. The experimental results show a \textit{speedup} of approximately 144~times from the simulation at ESL to the RTL simulation. The estimated ESL design effort was only 2~person~weeks, and the effort estimated for applying the Pipeline Algorithm and completely refine the property set was 8~person~days. For means of comparison a set of properties was created directly from the RTL implementation in a \textit{bottom-up} approach, and the estimated effort for creating property set was 1~person~month.

For future work, the proposed algorithm can be implemented and included into the DeSCAM tool so the process for generating properties for pipelined processors can be completely automatized. In the same manner, the generation of the \SSQED{} property set can be also implemented so a complete set of properties can automatically generated and then refined.
